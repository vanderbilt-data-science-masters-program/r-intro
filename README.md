The Carpentries is a combined effort of the Software Carpentry and the Data Carpentry. Since 1998, the Software Carpentry has provided training to researchers and scientists in programming, reproducible workflow, and computing skills. See https://software-carpentry.org/about/ for more information.

This lesson is a virtual worksheet version of the Data Carpentry *R for Social Science*. Clone this repo to your machine, and code along with the instructor during the workshop.
